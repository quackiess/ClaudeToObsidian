ClaudeArchive exports your Claude.ai conversations into an Obsidian vault with automatic hyperlinks, building a searchable map of your AI-assisted thinking over time. You will be able to see patterns within and across chats. The app also offers chat management features like deletion and customizable export settings. **Use with caution.**

The interface is straightforward - just check the readme for setup instructions and how to grab your session key from DevTools.

Example: chat about cellular respiration and photosynthesis, the output would show connecting links between related keywords that show up in both conversations. You can adjust how many keywords it tracks to control the length and detail of the connections.
