ClaudeArchive exports your Claude.ai conversations into an Obsidian vault with automatic hyperlinks, building a searchable map of your AI-assisted thinking over time. You will be able to see patterns within and across chats. The app also offers chat management features like deletion and customizable export settings. Each export will output a report with chat summaries and keyword frequencies. **Use with caution.**
Known bug: a bit aggressive with converting plurals into singulars. The stop word database is also being expanded.

The interface is straightforward - just check the readme for setup instructions and how to grab your session key from DevTools. 

Example: chat about cellular respiration and photosynthesis, the output would show connecting links between related keywords that show up in both conversations. You can adjust how many keywords it tracks to control the length and detail of the connections. These are only two chats; with more, you will be able to build a much bigger web!
